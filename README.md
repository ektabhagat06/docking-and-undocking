Hey there, this was a small little side project, which was a great learning experience for me and influenced me to focus more on bigger, more complex frameworks. I have now moved on to Laravel development, and if you think you're adding too much to this or any other raw PHP system, it may be high time for you to move onto a better framework like Laravel as well.
